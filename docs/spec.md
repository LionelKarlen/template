> Oneliner on what it does

# Vision
<!-- Paragraph on introductory details about the software, inspiration, initial idea. -->

<!-- Paragraph on solution overview, what is the software providing. Who is it for? How does it help them? What do we expect the software to do? -->

# Scope
<!-- What are the fundamental features we need? This is good to rely on to avoid feature drift, and to revist, should the scope change. List potential shortcomings of the planned system, future improvements and whether they could make sense. -->

# User Requirements
<!-- How do our users expect to interact with the software? What do they know, what do they *need* to know? This would be a good place to think about user stories (user a wants to do xzy; they go to abc and do uvw;), and the general hierarchy of the software, any public interface (api, ui). -->

# Functional Requirements
<!-- Functional requirements specify the **what** of the system, and can be thought of as the sentence "the system must do <requirement>". This list can become quite large, it would be best to create a hierarchy, where each requirement has a name, a unique number based on the hierarchy, and be accompanied by a description, or implementation detail. -->

# Non-functional Requirements
<!-- Non-functional requirements specify the **how** of the system, and can be thought of as the sentence "the system shall (be) <requirement>". They describe the ideals of the program, contracts that should hold, but are not necessarily technical in nature. This portion does not concern itself with implementations. -->

# Visual Requirements
<!-- Provide user interface mock-ups or templates. Include requirements for individual pages. Outline the visual language of the system, colours, themes, icons, imagery. -->
